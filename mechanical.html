    <h2>Department of Mechanical Engieering</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 150%">The Department of Mechanical Engineering was established in the same year as the inception of the institute viz. 1956. The department has come a long way, from an intake of 30 students at inception and pass through significant milestones to achieve the status of a globally known research centre.

        The Department is equipped with many state of art laboratories like Welding Research Cell, IC Engine Research Cell, FESEM Laboratory, Advanced Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, Rapid Prototyping Laboratory, to mention a few,  which cater to both academic and research requirements of students across the various programs in the department. Grant of over 8 crore rupees have been acquired by the department from various government agencies in various schemes for research and development in tune with the era. An MHRD (Govt. of India) funded Centre of Excellence in Manufacturing Sciences was established   in 2013. The department has been offering consultancies to various industries.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 150%">It is now a fully-developed with excellent learning resources and research opportunities for scholars from Undergraduate to Doctoral level in a wide spectrum of areas. The Department has a well-established team of 36 Faculty and 32 Technical Staff members, who facilitate the students to evolve into independent learners capable of turning challenges into opportunities and achieve zenith in their career. It fulfils the need of around 850 students undergoing UG, PG and PhD programs.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 150%">The Faculty members of the department have well-knit network with Universities and Industries as expert committee members. They are also globally known as Key-note speakers in conferences, Reviewers and Editors in Scopus Indexed Journals. The department strives to continuously improve the quality of education through evolving of curriculum and its content in tune with contemporary technology, and develop innovative solutions to technological challenges.</p>
